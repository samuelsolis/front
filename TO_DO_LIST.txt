TO DO LIST:

Current improvement ides are as follows:

a) Allow a custom front page based on user roles. 

for example on a music site based on drupal, specify a custom front page for Drummers and and alternative front page for Guitarists.

This is work in progress. 

Due to have an update in mid-febuar 2005.


Will update this area, though, if it proves to be practical and I find time to update it.


Hope you find it useful
