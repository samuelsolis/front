TO DO LIST:

Current improvement ides are as follows:

a) Allow a custom front page based on user roles. 

for example on a music site based on drupal, specify a custom front page for Drummers and and alternative front page for Guitarists.

This is work in progress. 

There is another module called SECTIONS.MODULE which I think will perform a similar function So I'm not sure if developing front_page.module further is a good idea.

Will update this area, though, if it proves to be practical and I find time to update it.


Hope you find it useful
