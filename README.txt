Introduction:
This module is for people who want their own custom page
like many modern sites. I mainly use this module for Flash Intros.

Usage:
1. Go to the admin section, from there access the modules and enable
   the front module.
2. Go to the admin section, and click on modules, front link.
3. Enter the HTML contents of the front page in the text area
4. Set your default page to be "front"
