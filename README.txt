Introduction:

This module is for people who want a custom front page to their Drupal sites.

Intended for Drupal version 4.5


Key Functionality:

1. Allows you to specify a custom front page to your site for visitors who are not-logged in.

2. Allows you to specify an alternative front page to your site for users who are already logged in.

3. Allows you to have a FULL front page - i.e. completely different layout to your main drupal site or a THEMED full page, i.e. it loads with your default drupal site theme & layout.

######### (update Dec. 16th 2004) #########

4. Allows you to automatically REDIRECT logged in users to a specific page or path.
