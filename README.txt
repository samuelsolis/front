Introduction:

This module is for people who want a custom front page to their Drupal sites.

THe key functionality of this module is outlined below. I recommend drupal site administrators look at SECTIONS.MODULE if you are looking to vary the theme/look of different sections of your site.

This module is intended for Drupal version 4.5 and later versions.


Key Functionality:

1. Allows you to specify a custom front page to your site for visitors who are not-logged in.

2. Allows you to specify an alternative front page to your site for users who are already logged in.

3. Allows you to have a FULL front page - i.e. completely different layout to your main drupal site or a THEMED full page, i.e. it loads with your default drupal site theme & layout.

4. Allows you to automatically REDIRECT logged in users to a specific page or path.

######### (update Feb. 15th 2005) #########

5. Updated with a PHP checkbox that allows drupal site administrators to include PHP in their front page(s). (Thanks Scott!)

Hope you find it useful. 

This module has been developed by a few members of the drupal community and we're always looking for ideas for improving it. Email me or post a message on the drupal.org site if you have any ideas on how we can improve the module.
